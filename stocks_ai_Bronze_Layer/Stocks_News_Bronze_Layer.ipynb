What started 40 years ago as a company focused on \"quality communications\" by Irwin Jacobs has morphed into Qualcomm (QCOM) today. The company is one of the biggest players in the chip industry, supplying products to Apple (AAPL) to power its iPhone and to automakers to power their increasingly digital cockpits. The company's market cap stands at an impressive $163 billion. At the helm as CEO since 2021 is 30-year Qualcomm veteran Cristiano Amon, who started at the company as an engineer. Amon has been moving aggressively to diversify the business away from Apple into areas such as industrial applications and, more recently, data centers. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Amon to discuss the next 40 years for Qualcomm. Amon is fresh off a trip to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump and other top tech executives. Amon secured a key memorandum of understanding to help Saudi Arabia build out AI data centers. Sozzi and Amon discuss the trip and what greater trade tensions mean for Qualcomm's important China business. Last year, China represented 46% of Qualcomm's sales.

It wasn’t immediately clear what was weighing on Nvidia, although one factor could be lingering trade uncertainty, with investors on edge amid a flare-up in tariff tensions between China and the U.S.  Equity analyst Blayne Curtis expects the ramp of Nvidia’s Blackwell artificial-intelligence chips to drive the company’s gross margin to somewhere between 70% and 80% this year, up from 61% as of its fiscal first quarter, which ended April 27.</td><td>2025-06-03</td></tr><tr><td>NVDA</td><td>President Donald Trump set out a plan to impose tariffs on imports, a move analysts and economists said could weigh on growth.

The company is one of the biggest players in the chip industry, supplying products to Apple (AAPL) to power its iPhone and to automakers to power their increasingly digital cockpits. The company's market cap stands at an impressive $163 billion. At the helm as CEO since 2021 is 30-year Qualcomm veteran Cristiano Amon, who started at the company as an engineer. Amon has been moving aggressively to diversify the business away from Apple into areas such as industrial applications and, more recently, data centers. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Amon to discuss the next 40 years for Qualcomm. Amon is fresh off a trip to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump and other top tech executives. Amon secured a key memorandum of understanding to help Saudi Arabia build out AI data centers. Sozzi and Amon discuss the trip and what greater trade tensions mean for Qualcomm's important China business. Last year, China represented 46% of Qualcomm's sales.

         "(Reuters) -Procter & Gamble said on Thursday it would cut 7,000 jobs, or about 6%, of its total workforce over the next two years, as part of a new restructuring plan to counter uneven consumer demand and higher costs due to tariff uncertainty.  The world's largest consumer goods company also plans to exit some product categories and brands in certain markets, executives said at a Deutsche Bank Consumer Conference in Paris, adding the program could likely include some divestitures without giving detail.  The Pampers maker's two-year restructuring plan comes when consumer spending is expected to remain pressured this year, and global consumer goods makers including P&G and Unilever brace for a further hit to demand from even higher prices.",

The company is one of the biggest players in the chip industry, supplying products to Apple (AAPL) to power its iPhone and to automakers to power their increasingly digital cockpits. The company's market cap stands at an impressive $163 billion. At the helm as CEO since 2021 is 30-year Qualcomm veteran Cristiano Amon, who started at the company as an engineer. Amon has been moving aggressively to diversify the business away from Apple into areas such as industrial applications and, more recently, data centers. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Amon to discuss the next 40 years for Qualcomm. Amon is fresh off a trip to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump and other top tech executives. Amon secured a key memorandum of understanding to help Saudi Arabia build out AI data centers. Sozzi and Amon discuss the trip and what greater trade tensions mean for Qualcomm's important China business. Last year, China represented 46% of Qualcomm's sales.
